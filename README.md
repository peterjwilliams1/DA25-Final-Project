# DA25-Final-Project

GOAL: The goal is to include as much content from the Bootcamp as possible (Xstaliyation of Bootcamp in 10 minutes)
- Python, Tableau, SQL (likely no real application in this project)
- Data Cleaning & Wrangling
- Data Analysis - Python
  - Analysis of Meteorite Impacts
  - Geolocation of known impacts
  - History of counts
  - History of counts by country
  - Map showing counts by country
- Data Visualisation
  - Tableau for visualisation and map plotting of impact sites
- Webscraping (API not neccessary for this project)
  - Geopy for geo-location data
  - Population Data
- Probability
  - Are Meteorite Falls Evenly Distributed Across Decades?
  - Are Meteorite Masses Normally Distributed?
- Machine Learning
  - Predicting Meteorite Impact Mass
  - Predicting Meteorite Fall Likelihood
