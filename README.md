  fall status (whether the meteorite was observed falling or found later), and geographical coordinates.'

Analysis of Meteorite Impacts
  - Geolocation of known impacts
  - History of Counts
  - History of Counts by Country

Prediction of impact areas using Machine Learning

Enrichment of data using Population data

 - Possible enrichment of data using UFO sightings just for fun

 - Relationship of Meteorite mass to ability to survive atmosphere
    - Mean mass and standard devaitions
    - Minimum Mass(?)
    - Box plots of masses?
